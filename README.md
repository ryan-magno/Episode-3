## Introduction

In this project, we explore various techniques for extracting data from websites using Python. We also provide instructions for setting up WSL on your machine and configuring FTP for data transfer.

## Data Extraction from Web

In the [data_extraction](data_extraction) directory, you will find code examples and tutorials for extracting data from web pages using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests.

## WSL Setup

The [wsl_setup](wsl_setup) directory contains step-by-step instructions for setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on your Windows machine. WSL allows you to run a Linux environment alongside your Windows operating system.

## FTP Configuration

In the [ftp_configuration](ftp_configuration) directory, you will find code examples and instructions for configuring FTP using Python. This will enable you to transfer files between your local machine and a remote server using the FTP protocol.

## Usage
